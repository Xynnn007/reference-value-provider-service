# Simple Cache

This is only a test Cache implement. Simple Cache will
store validated reference value into RAM. Thus when the
RVPS's core object is destroyed, all the data will be 
released. So this is only for test. We strongly recommend
that a persistent storage is used. In order to avoid 
information loss when it comes to a restart or crash.
